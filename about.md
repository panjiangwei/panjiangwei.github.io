# About

Hi, I'm **Jiangwei Pan**.

I'm a research scientist at Netflix, where I work on personalization algorithms. My focus is on building systems that help people find content they'll enjoy, at scale.

## Why This Blog?

The software industry is full of hype cycles and buzzwords. This blog is about cutting through the noise and focusing on what actually matters: building systems that work, writing maintainable code, and shipping value to users.

**1X Engineering** is a reminder that you don't need to be a "rockstar" or a "ninja" to be a good engineer. You just need to show up, do solid work, and keep learning.

## What I Write About

Expect posts on:
- Practical algorithms and systems design
- Real-world machine learning and personalization
- Engineering fundamentals that stand the test of time
- Lessons learned from building production systems
