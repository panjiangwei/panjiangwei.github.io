Welcome to **1X Engineering**, a blog about practical software engineering and getting things done without the hype.

## What is 1X Engineering?

While the industry obsesses over "10x engineers" and rockstar developers, we believe in something different: **1X Engineering**. This is about:

- Writing code that works and is maintainable
- Shipping features that users actually need
- Making incremental improvements over time
- Focusing on fundamentals rather than fads
- Being a reliable, solid engineer who gets things done

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find posts about:

- **Practical coding techniques** - Real solutions to real problems
- **System design** - Building systems that scale appropriately
- **Developer productivity** - Working smarter, not harder
- **Code quality** - Writing maintainable, testable code
- **War stories** - Lessons learned from the trenches

## The 1X Philosophy

Being a 1X engineer means:

1. **Consistency over brilliance** - Show up every day and do good work
2. **Clarity over cleverness** - Write code that others can understand
3. **Shipping over perfection** - Done is better than perfect
4. **Learning over knowing** - Stay curious and keep growing
5. **Team over individual** - Lift others up

## Let's Build Together

Software engineering is a craft that takes time to master. There are no shortcuts, no magic frameworks, no silver bullets. Just hard work, continuous learning, and a commitment to doing things right.

Join me on this journey of building software the 1X way.
